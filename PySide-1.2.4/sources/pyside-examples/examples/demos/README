These demonstrations are intended to highlight PyQt's capabilities in different
application areas, and provide examples that are more advanced than other
examples.

Beginners to PyQt may wish to try out the PyQt tutorial and some of the other
examples before examining the demonstrations in detail.

The examples and demos launcher can be used to explore the different categories
available.  It provides an overview of each example, lets you view the
documentation in Qt Assistant, and is able to launch the examples and demos.
