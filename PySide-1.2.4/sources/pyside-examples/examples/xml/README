XML parsing and handling is supported through SAX and DOM compliant APIs.

PyQt's SAX compliant classes allow you to parse XML incrementally; the DOM
classes enable more complex document-level operations to be performed on
XML files.


The example launcher provided with PyQt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorial and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
