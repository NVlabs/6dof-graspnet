PySide comes with a plenty of example applications, illustrating the
usage and functionality of different Qt functionality and concepts from
Python.

The examples are organized into topical subdirectories within the
current directory. To browse and run the examples, change to the
relevant directory and run the example there, either on the command line
or by using your favourite file manager.

The majority of the examples have been ported as-is from PyQt, in which
case the original boilerplates have been retained. Hence, although
PySide itself is licensed under LGPLv2.1, most of the examples are
licensed under GPLv2.

We have tried to ensure that every example works with PySide. If you
experience unexpected results when running any of the examples, PLEASE
report the issue at PySide Bugzilla [1]. This will greatly help us
improve the quality of PySide future releases.
