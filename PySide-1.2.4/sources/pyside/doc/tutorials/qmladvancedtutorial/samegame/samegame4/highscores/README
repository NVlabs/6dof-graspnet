The SameGame example can interface with a simple PHP script to store XML high score data on a remote server. We do not have a publically accessible server available for this use, but if you have access to a PHP capable webserver you can copy the files (score_data.xml, score.php, score_style.xsl) to it and alter the highscore_server variable at the top of the samegame.js file to point to it.
