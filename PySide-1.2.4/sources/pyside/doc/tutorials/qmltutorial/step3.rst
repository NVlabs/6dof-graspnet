QML Tutorial 3 - States and Transitions
***************************************

In this chapter, we make this example a little bit more dynamic by introducing states and transitions.

We want our text to move to the bottom of the screen, rotate and become red when clicked.

Here is the QML code:

.. pysideinclude:: helloworld/tutorial3.qml

Walkthrough
===========

.. pysideinclude:: helloworld/tutorial3.qml
    :snippet: 2

First, we create a new *down* state for our text element.
This state will be activated when the MouseArea is pressed, and deactivated when it is released.

The *down* state includes a set of property changes from our implicit *default state*
(the items as they were initially defined in the QML).
Specifically, we set the ``y`` property of the text to ``160``, the rotation to ``180`` and the ``color`` to red.

.. pysideinclude:: helloworld/tutorial3.qml
    :snippet: 3

Because we don't want the text to appear at the bottom instantly but rather move smoothly,
we add a transition between our two states.

``from`` and ``to`` define the states between which the transition will run.
In this case, we want a transition from the default state to our *down* state.

Because we want the same transition to be run in reverse when changing back from the *down* state to the default state,
we set ``reversible`` to ``true``.
This is equivalent to writing the two transitions separately.

The ParallelAnimation element makes sure that the two types of animations (number and color) start at the same time.
We could also run them one after the other by using SequentialAnimation instead.
