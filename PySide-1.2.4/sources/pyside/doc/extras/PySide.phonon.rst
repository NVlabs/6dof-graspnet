Phonon is a cross-platform multimedia framework that enables the use of audio and video content in Qt applications. The Phonon Overview document provides an introduction to the architecture and features included in Phonon. The Phonon namespace contains a list of all classes, functions and namespaces provided by the module.

To include the definitions of modules classes, use the following directive:

::

    import PySide.phonon

Qt Backends
-----------

Qt Backends are currently developed for Phonon version 4.1. The Phonon project has moved on and introduced new features that the Qt Backends do not implement. We have chosen not to document the part of Phonon that we do not support. Any class or function not appearing in our documentation can be considered unsupported.
