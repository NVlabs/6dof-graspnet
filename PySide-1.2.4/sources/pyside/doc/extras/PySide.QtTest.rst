To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

::

    import PySide.QtTest

.. note:: All macros in the C++ version of QtTest were not binded in PySide, this module is useful only for GUI testing and benchmarking, for ordinary unit testing you should use the ``unittest`` Python module.
